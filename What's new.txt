CPS1 SUPPORT!
	After bashing against that wall for a while, the stitcher
	is now compatible with most CPS1 Games! There are fringe cases
	like Forgotten Worlds where the Stitcher isn't suitable, but by
	and large still usable with the majority of CPS1 games i've seen.
	The only real distinction between adding a CPS1 game as opposed to
	CPS2 is that there are a couple new vars to accomodate varying Group
	Sizes, and how many bytes to interleave per group
	For example, Final Fight is setup like this:
	
	gfx_prefix = ["ff-5m.7a", "ff-7m.9a", "ff-1m.3a", "ff-3m.5a"]

	group_size = [4]
	group_collec_size = [2]

	#Total size of each ROM group
	rsize0 = 2 << 18 #524288 bytes, or 512KB
	rsize1 = 2 << 19 #1048576 bytes, or 1MB
	rsize2 = 2 << 20 #2097152 bytes, or 2MB
	rsize3 = 2 << 21 #4194304 bytes, or 4MB
	rsize4 = 2 << 22 #8388608 bytes, or 8MB
	gfx_romsize = [rsize0]
	
	This will probably be adjusted at some point to accomodate games like
	Forgotten Worlds, but should still prove useful, i hope.

NEO-GEO: PREFIX_OVERRIDE
	In order to accomodate Samurai Shodown 1, adjusted the code
	so now you can define a prefix_override array to read files of
	varying cx prefixes. In the case of Samsho 1, it's prefix_override
	looks like this

	prefix_override = [1,2,3,4,51,61]

	This indicates to the stitcher to read, in order,
	c1.c1
	c2.c2
	c3.c3
	c4.c4
	c51.c5
	c61.c6
